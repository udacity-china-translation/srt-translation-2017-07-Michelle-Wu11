00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,325
We look that git commits dash dash amend flag to reword or update the most recent commit.

2
00:00:06,325 --> 00:00:10,039
We looked at the git revert command to undo a specific commit,

3
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:14,774
and we just looked at the git reset command to reset or erase changes,

4
00:00:14,775 --> 00:00:17,574
but remember to be careful with that last one.

5
00:00:17,574 --> 00:00:22,000
Knowing how to fix mistakes definitely gave me the confidence to experiment,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,129
and hope you feel more confident making changes now that you know how undo them.
