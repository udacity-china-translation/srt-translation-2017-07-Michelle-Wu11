1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
There are a number of version control systems out there,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,004
but three of the most popular are Git, Subversion and Mercurial.

3
00:00:08,005 --> 00:00:11,599
Not only are there dozens and dozens of different version control systems,

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,974
there are actually two different categories.

5
00:00:13,974 --> 00:00:17,850
There's the centralized model and then the distributed model.

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,849
In a centralized model there's one all powerful central computer that hosts the project;

7
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:25,815
every interaction must go through this central computer.

8
00:00:25,815 --> 00:00:30,405
In the distributed model there's no central repository of information.

9
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,600
Each developer has a complete copy of the project on their computer,

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,368
which is cool because that means you can also work off line.

11
00:00:36,368 --> 00:00:39,534
In this course we'll be using the version control system Git,

12
00:00:39,534 --> 00:00:42,993
which is a distributed version control system.

13
00:00:42,993 --> 00:00:45,009
Now, you might have heard of Git hub.

14
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:47,884
Git and GitHub are quite different.

15
00:00:47,884 --> 00:00:49,810
Git, is the version control tool,

16
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,635
while GitHub is the service that hosts Git projects.

17
00:00:53,634 --> 00:00:56,844
To work with Git projects you're not required to use GitHub,

18
00:00:56,844 --> 00:00:59,350
but it's an awesome tool and you should definitely check it out.

19
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,539
For now, you can think of it as basically,

20
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:04,540
just another computer where you can upload a copy of your project.

21
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,879
Centralized, distributed, if these

22
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:09,454
don't make a lot of sense right now, that's totally fine.

23
00:01:09,453 --> 00:01:13,048
This is to give you a big picture idea of where things fit together.

24
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,954
These terms are more important if you're working with a team but

25
00:01:15,953 --> 00:01:20,000
you'll be working locally on your computer for the entirety of this course.
