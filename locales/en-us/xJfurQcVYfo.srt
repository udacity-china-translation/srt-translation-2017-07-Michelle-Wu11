00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,378
We're looking at the log of commits that have been made in this repository.

2
00:00:04,378 --> 00:00:07,649
This is one commit, here is another.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:11,019
Look at all of the information that the log is displaying.

4
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:12,765
It's showing the commits Shaw,

5
00:00:12,765 --> 00:00:14,737
the person who made the commit,

6
00:00:14,737 --> 00:00:16,454
the date the commit was made,

7
00:00:16,454 --> 00:00:18,809
and the message for the commit.

8
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:22,984
This is just a short description of what changes were made in this commit.

9
00:00:22,984 --> 00:00:26,850
Now these are just the first three or so commits that can fit on the screen.

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,260
There are plenty more.

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,615
How do I know that? The colon here

12
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:33,420
means that there are more lines of output to be displayed.

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,520
If you're familiar with the command line,

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,845
GIT uses the less program as its pager.

15
00:00:38,844 --> 00:00:41,729
If you're not familiar with less or pagers that's no problem.

16
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:44,739
A pager is used to page through content.

17
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,550
This is just the command line e-way of scrolling.

18
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:52,619
Press either the J key or the down arrow to scroll down one line at a time.

19
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:56,280
To scroll up press the K key or the up arrow.

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,314
You'll know you've reached the very last commit when the colon changes to the word end.

21
00:01:01,314 --> 00:01:04,170
To get out of the pager just press the Q key.
