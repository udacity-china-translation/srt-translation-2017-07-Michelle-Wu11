00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,319
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:04,605
Today we'll be learning all about version control,

3
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:06,620
and we'll be using the version control tool

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,199
Git to help us manage different versions of our project.

5
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:12,809
Now, before we dive into some of the nitty gritty details,

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,199
let me tell you a story, because who doesn't love story time?

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,044
Back in the day, my brother and his best friend would play games all the time.

8
00:00:20,045 --> 00:00:24,325
But, one of their favorite board games was a popular World War II strategy board game.

9
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:25,919
The board game shows a map of the world,

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,679
and you put pieces on the board and move them around.

11
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:32,630
I didn't really care for the game all that much because it would take so long to play.

12
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,565
Sometimes, they'd be playing a single game for a day or more.

13
00:00:35,564 --> 00:00:38,958
Now, because there's a big board with lots of pieces that move around,

14
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:40,365
if they had to pause the game,

15
00:00:40,365 --> 00:00:43,245
they would snap a picture with their phone.

16
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:45,009
They'd use these pictures as save

17
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:47,799
points in case anything happened to the board or the pieces,

18
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,779
like someone bumping the table or the dog

19
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,590
coming along and knocking the pieces everywhere.

20
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:53,950
If there were a problem,

21
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,660
they could use a picture to recreate

22
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:58,889
the exact setup and jump back to that point in the game.

23
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,395
So each of these pictures is a save point.

24
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,137
The pictures record the time,

25
00:01:03,137 --> 00:01:06,670
who took the picture, and the state and location of the pieces.

26
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:11,680
This idea of a save point is exactly what version control does.

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,955
You don't seem all that impressed.

28
00:01:14,954 --> 00:01:17,659
Well, let me tell you that it's incredibly powerful and I

29
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:20,978
love having it because when you use version control,

30
00:01:20,978 --> 00:01:23,825
you create safe points that save your project.

31
00:01:23,825 --> 00:01:26,350
This lets you have the freedom to change absolutely anything about

32
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:29,559
your project and be confident that nothing will be lost.

33
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,448
Total security and total freedom,

34
00:01:31,448 --> 00:01:32,834
who wouldn't want that?

35
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:35,334
And you get all of that with a version control system.

36
00:01:35,334 --> 00:01:37,058
Sounds pretty awesome, right?

37
00:01:37,058 --> 00:01:38,515
So hi, I'm Richard,

38
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,870
and I've been using version control for years,

39
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,785
and Git has saved me from countless sticky situations.

40
00:01:43,784 --> 00:01:47,289
For example, one time I'd realized I deleted an important image,

41
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:51,790
but I was able to recover it because the project was being tracked with version control.

42
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:56,030
It's an incredibly helpful tool and you'll grow to depend on it as much as I do.

43
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,579
You ready to get started?

44
00:01:57,578 --> 00:01:59,000
Awesome, let's get going.
