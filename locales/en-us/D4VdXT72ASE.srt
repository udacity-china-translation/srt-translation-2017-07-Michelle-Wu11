1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
Let's start at the beginning,

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,094
because it's a very good place to start.

3
00:00:04,094 --> 00:00:06,246
We've got a project with some files,

4
00:00:06,246 --> 00:00:08,689
and we add these files together and make a commit,

5
00:00:08,689 --> 00:00:10,500
and it has this SHA.

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,839
Now let's give ourselves a bit more room by

7
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:15,564
shrinking this down and displaying just the first letter.

8
00:00:15,564 --> 00:00:17,910
Great, so we have this one commit.

9
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,585
Now let's make a few more changes to the project and commit them.

10
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:24,914
Awesome. So let's say that the most recent commit

11
00:00:24,914 --> 00:00:29,000
that starts with the f is where our project is at version 1.0.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,859
How would we indicate this in git?

13
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:33,149
We don't want to write this in the commit message.

14
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:35,234
Perhaps we can list this in the body of the commit message,

15
00:00:35,234 --> 00:00:37,000
but that's not ideal either.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,270
We can use a tag to indicate this.

17
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,650
Tags let you point out particular commits to make them stand out from others,

18
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,314
and we can label the tag with something like v1.0.

19
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:51,454
Let's add another commit. See how the tag stays locked to a commit?

20
00:00:51,454 --> 00:00:53,225
Let's give ourselves a bit more room.

21
00:00:53,225 --> 00:00:57,480
A tag stays locked to a commit even as more commits are added to the repository.
