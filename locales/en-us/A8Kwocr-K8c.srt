1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,634
Let's run the git log -p command to see the commits,

2
00:00:04,634 --> 00:00:10,879
but also include the actual code changes or patch made to the files.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,172
This first part is the same as the regular git log command.

4
00:00:14,172 --> 00:00:16,425
Just like the --stat flag,

5
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:23,700
the -p or --patch flag will add extra information below the standard commit info.

6
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,155
This is the start of the patch output.

7
00:00:27,155 --> 00:00:29,515
I admit this output is a bit cryptic,

8
00:00:29,515 --> 00:00:31,560
so bear with me just a second because you won't

9
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:34,060
really look at the top few lines most of the time,

10
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,216
but it's good to know what they are.

11
00:00:36,216 --> 00:00:39,759
A diff and a patch refer to the same thing.

12
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:41,849
The patch is showing the difference between

13
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,810
the original version of the file and the changed version of the file.

14
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,315
We're looking at the CSS file.

15
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:49,979
There's the first version of the file.

16
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:54,274
It shows up in a directory called "a" because it's the first.

17
00:00:54,274 --> 00:00:57,144
That's not a directory you'll actually see in the repo though.

18
00:00:57,145 --> 00:00:58,835
And then there's the second version.

19
00:00:58,835 --> 00:01:02,685
It shows up in a "b" directory because it's the second.

20
00:01:02,685 --> 00:01:05,159
These two are the same name because we're looking

21
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,119
at two different versions of the same file.

22
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,760
These could be different if the file was renamed.

23
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,590
Yep, git can keep track of renamed files.

24
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,540
Pretty cool, right? Now, back to the output.

25
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,230
This line shows the hash of the first version of

26
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:23,300
the file before the change and the hash after the change.

27
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:26,394
These hashes are different from the commit SHA.

28
00:01:26,394 --> 00:01:28,729
I never really look at this line.

29
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,515
These two are the same as these right here.

30
00:01:31,515 --> 00:01:34,170
They are the old and new versions of the files.

31
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,010
We'll come back to this line in just a second.

32
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,460
Now, this is the actual code of the CSS file.

33
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:44,489
These lines here that are both in green and have

34
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:49,704
the plus symbol in front of them mean that these lines have been added in this commit.

35
00:01:49,704 --> 00:01:51,894
Let's jump back to this line now.

36
00:01:51,894 --> 00:01:55,524
This is telling us where in the file the edits are made.

37
00:01:55,525 --> 00:01:58,650
This says that in the old or original version of the file,

38
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:03,815
this code is from line 38 and then that's showing six lines of code.

39
00:02:03,814 --> 00:02:05,974
Those six lines are here: one,

40
00:02:05,974 --> 00:02:10,109
two, three, four, five, six.

41
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,305
In the new or current version of the file,

42
00:02:13,305 --> 00:02:15,370
it starts on line 38 as well,

43
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:20,730
but now there are 11 lines of code: the original six plus the five new ones.

44
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:23,664
We can see all 11 lines right here.

45
00:02:23,664 --> 00:02:26,185
Now, this commit only has additions.

46
00:02:26,185 --> 00:02:29,555
What does it look like when lines are removed? Well, let's look.

47
00:02:29,555 --> 00:02:33,250
We need to scroll down to the next commit. Here it is.

48
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,016
This first patch output is of the CSS file again,

49
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:42,030
and here is the patch output of the HTML file.

50
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,449
The lines that have been removed by the commit are in red and begin with the minus sign.

51
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:50,139
Something to note here that's very important.

52
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:55,279
Git tracks edits by lines so if an edit is made to a line,

53
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,890
it will show the line being removed and then added again.

54
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:01,328
For example, it says "main" was deleted,

55
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:04,375
but then here it says "main" was added again.

56
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,860
The "div" with the class container was added,

57
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,680
and the "main" element and all its code was indented,

58
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,079
so it nest's correctly in the HTML file.

59
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:15,155
Indenting this line changed it.

60
00:03:15,155 --> 00:03:19,400
So, to git, this line with one indentation was removed,

61
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,069
while this one with two indents was added.

62
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,844
I know there's a lot of information in the patch output,

63
00:03:25,844 --> 00:03:29,625
but some of it is redundant and some of it can be ignored.

64
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:33,930
The important things in the patch output are: the file we're looking at,

65
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:39,139
the changes, and it's sometimes helpful to know where in the file the changes were made.
