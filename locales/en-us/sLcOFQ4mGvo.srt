00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,290
This is the lesson where we finally learn how to make commits of our very own.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,374
Are you excited? Because I am.

3
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:10,974
We've laid the groundwork of learning the git init command to create a new repository,

4
00:00:10,974 --> 00:00:14,309
the git clone command to copy an existing repository,

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,054
the git log command to review existing commits,

6
00:00:17,054 --> 00:00:21,644
and the all important git status command to see the status of the repository.

7
00:00:21,644 --> 00:00:25,245
As a side note, remember to have a download sheet with all the terms handy

8
00:00:25,245 --> 00:00:29,550
during this lesson since we'll be using almost every term on that sheet.

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,859
So we have these as the foundation we'll

10
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,798
build on top of them in this lesson with git add,

11
00:00:34,798 --> 00:00:37,213
git commit, and git diff.

12
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:42,104
With git add, you'll add files from the working directory to the staging index.

13
00:00:42,104 --> 00:00:45,089
With git commit, you'll take files from the staging index and save

14
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,515
them in the repository which is what actually makes a commit.

15
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:51,000
The git diff command is really cool and will seem pretty

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,500
familiar actually since you've already seen its output before.

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,655
git diff displays the difference between two versions of a file.

18
00:00:58,655 --> 00:01:00,719
Its output is exactly like the output of

19
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,379
the git log dash p command we used in the previous lesson.

20
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,989
So we've got a couple of new commands and one that's going to be very familiar.

21
00:01:07,989 --> 00:01:10,979
Now before we can use the commit or diff commands we have to

22
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,020
learn how to use git add. So let's get cracking.
