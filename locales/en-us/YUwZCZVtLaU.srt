1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,810
So the answer is no, that even with any

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,860
of these restrictions, we still don't have a good

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,400
definition. So, let's consider all the restrictions. So, the

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,170
first one was, if everyone is friends with Alice. So

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,810
that would only work if they don't have any

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,870
other friends. Let's say this is Alice. We've got

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,860
Bob and Charlie. They're both friends with Alice. But

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,320
Bob is also friends with Charlie and Charlie is friends

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,590
with Bob. That means that to figure out the popularity of

10
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,830
Bob we need to know the popularity of Charlie. To figure

11
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,000
out the popularity of Charlie we need to know the popularity

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,870
of Alice as well as the popularity of Bob. So we're never

13
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,390
going to get to a solution. We are going to keep

14
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,200
bouncing back and forth between Bob and Charlie doing this. The

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,810
second choice only if no one is friends with Alice. Well,

16
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,850
if no one was friends with Alice, that would remove these links.

17
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,730
It doesn't solve our problem. We're still not going to be able

18
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,340
to give a popularity score for Bob and Charlie. The third choice

19
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,370
only if there is a friendship path from everyone in the graph

20
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:04,635
that eventually reaches Alice. So adding this link would provide that property,

21
00:01:04,635 --> 00:01:07,490
but it still doesn't solve our problem. It doesn't give us a

22
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,930
way to figure out the popularity of Charlie, because to know that,

23
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,250
we need to know the popularity of Bob, which we need to

24
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,200
know the popularity of Charlie for. We still end up in this cycle.

25
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,950
The final choice seems, possibly more promising. It says

26
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,250
there are no cycles in the graph, so if

27
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,590
we want to remove this cycle. We could do

28
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,680
this. In this case, we'd be okay, right? We could

29
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,050
figure out the popularity of Bob, by figuring out

30
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,200
the popularity of Charlie, which depends on the popularity

31
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,060
of Alice. Where we're not okay, is if Bob

32
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,390
has another friend. Let's say Bob is friends with Diana.

33
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,540
Well then, to figure out the popularity of Diana,

34
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,990
we need to know the popularity of Bob. Where

35
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,000
it breaks down is, suppose we also have Diana

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,030
and Edgar, and Diana's friends with Edgar. To figure out

37
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:57,328
the popularity score of Diana, we need to know the popularity score

38
00:01:57,328 --> 00:01:59,180
of Edgar. We don't have a cycle, but we don't have an answer

39
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,305
either. To figure out the popularity of Edgar,. We are going to go through

40
00:02:02,305 --> 00:02:05,980
Edgar's friends, and the way the Python code is written. This could actually

41
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:10,550
work, right? Because if we define popularity when you have no friends.

42
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,960
Well, if the friends of p is empty, when we go through this

43
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,510
loop, the score is going to be 0. So, if you answered there are

44
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:21,330
no cycles. That's at least worth credit for this, that could be correct.

45
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,650
In terms of the mathematical definition, it doesn't make very good

46
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,950
sense. We still needed a way to know the popularity of

47
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,050
Edgar. We've sort of defined things in this case to say,

48
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,900
if you have no friends, your popularity score is zero. And

49
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,480
the Python code will work for that. But it's not a

50
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,080
good way to define popularity. So its very arbitrary to say

51
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,270
we're going to make Alice the one whose popularity score is predefined

52
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,580
as one. There is nothing Alice could do to make herself

53
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,280
more popular. That's not very fair to

54
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,550
Alice and it doesn't give us meaningful scores.
