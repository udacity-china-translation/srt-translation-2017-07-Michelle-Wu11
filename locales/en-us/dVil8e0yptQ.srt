1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,695
Let's say we have a repository that is made up of these three files.

2
00:00:04,695 --> 00:00:07,724
We want to start using version control in this project.

3
00:00:07,724 --> 00:00:09,754
So we create a new git repository.

4
00:00:09,755 --> 00:00:11,069
In a git repository,

5
00:00:11,069 --> 00:00:13,920
there are three main areas we need to know about.

6
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:15,833
First, there's the working directory,

7
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:17,556
then there's the staging index,

8
00:00:17,556 --> 00:00:19,649
and last is the repository.

9
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:22,129
So we have these three distinct areas in git.

10
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:23,750
When you're first working with git,

11
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,984
it can be a bit hard to realize that there are these three distinct areas,

12
00:00:26,984 --> 00:00:31,524
because you don't really see any visible change to the files on your computer.

13
00:00:31,524 --> 00:00:33,795
Git manages these three different areas though,

14
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:36,450
and we'll be using the git shell command to interact

15
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,650
with files and move them from section to section.

16
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:42,820
Okay, so we've created this empty git repository,

17
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,725
we can tell it's an empty repository because the repository section is empty.

18
00:00:46,725 --> 00:00:49,785
Git knows about files that it hasn't seen before.

19
00:00:49,784 --> 00:00:52,709
Let's indicate that a file is new with a green star.

20
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,465
Git keeps track of files by adding them to the repository.

21
00:00:56,465 --> 00:00:59,535
We can't move these files right into the repository though,

22
00:00:59,534 --> 00:01:02,375
they have to be moved to the staging index first.

23
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:05,680
So will use git to move the changes to the staging index.

24
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,845
Remember that the staging index is where you can place

25
00:01:07,844 --> 00:01:10,685
all of the files that are about to be committed.

26
00:01:10,685 --> 00:01:13,930
Now let's commit them, which moves them into the repository.

27
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,485
Now the files in their current state are safe.

28
00:01:17,484 --> 00:01:20,745
Let's say we then make some changes to our sites CSS file.

29
00:01:20,745 --> 00:01:24,510
Git sees this change and marks the file as modified.

30
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,609
We take the same steps to move the changes in

31
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:30,150
the CSS file to the staging index, and then commit them.

32
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,215
I think you get the idea,

33
00:01:31,215 --> 00:01:33,284
but let's look at it one more time.

34
00:01:33,284 --> 00:01:36,659
Let's say the HTML and JavaScript files have changed.

35
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,729
Remember that git knows what files are new or changed.

36
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,109
We'll move these changes to the staging index, and then commit them.

37
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:47,028
So the process is, add a new file or modify an existing file,

38
00:01:47,028 --> 00:01:49,155
move the changes to the staging index,

39
00:01:49,155 --> 00:01:52,162
commit the changes to the repository. You got it?

40
00:01:52,162 --> 00:01:54,548
Okay then, what about this scenario,

41
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:59,665
let's say the HTML and CSS files have changed and we staged the changes.

42
00:01:59,665 --> 00:02:03,015
If we then decide to modify the HTML file again,

43
00:02:03,015 --> 00:02:05,355
what would happen if we made a commit right now?

44
00:02:05,355 --> 00:02:07,320
Seems like a good time for a quiz.
