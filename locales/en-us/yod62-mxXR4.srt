00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,889
Lessons three, four and

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:06,650
five will dive into the technical
details of how to run A/B tests online.

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,570
Before we do that, though,
we wanted to talk about how to consider

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,770
the ethics of your AB test and
how to protect your users.

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,660
>> This lesson gives a high level
overview of the questions and

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,190
principles that you should think
about while designing, running, and

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,900
analyzing your experiment.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,800
We'll start with some case studies
to motivate the importance of

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,100
thinking through the ethics.

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,170
And then go through the four
major principles to consider,

11
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,066
before summarizing the main principles
that you should be answering for

12
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,760
your proposed AB test.

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,470
>> Many people and

14
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,763
companies don't necessarily give
much thought to these issues.

15
00:00:37,763 --> 00:00:41,080
After all if your a streaming
video service, a review site, or

16
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,190
your selling handmade goods or meals,
is the service your providing really

17
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,040
affecting people to the degree where
you need to think about ethics?

18
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,160
>> Realistically in most
cases that's probably right.

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,140
>> But, you know, you can get to
a gray line pretty quickly if you

20
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,090
think about how integrated these
services are in people's lives.

21
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,530
Even for streaming video,

22
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,440
what if those videos are used
to teach the Heimlich Maneuver?

23
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,250
>> Our goal in this lesson is to
highlight the types of issues that

24
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,360
you should keep in mind as you
design and run experiments.

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,650
Because those issues may
affect little decisions,

26
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,010
from what type of user identification
you use to divert someone into

27
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:19,270
the experiment, to what data you capture
or whether you run the A/B test at all.

28
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,890
>> That said, this will only
be a high level introduction.

29
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,070
Many of these issues are highly nuanced.

30
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,380
And our goal is to give
you an idea of the basics.

31
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,520
If you're really running into
potential tests that are questionable,

32
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,900
which hopefully these principles
will help you determine,

33
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,170
then you should be seeking
expert advice and counsel.
