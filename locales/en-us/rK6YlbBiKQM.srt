1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,549
Let's go over the structure of this course.

2
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:06,580
First, we'll learn how to work with text and numeric data.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,405
We'll explore Python build-in functions and methods,

4
00:00:09,404 --> 00:00:12,969
so that we can do useful work without having to write lots of new code of our own.

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,900
Then, we'll put together these basic parts,

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,060
create data structures to hold information,

7
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,799
and write our own functions.

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,505
This means you'll be able to write Python programs to automate the things you care about.

9
00:00:23,504 --> 00:00:25,649
For example, watch out scores on a bunch of

10
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:28,439
individual restaurant of use and tell their overall rating.

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,980
It will clean noisy data sets by removing duplicate injuries and sorting them.

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,590
You'll get the opportunity to apply

13
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,575
what you've learned to a real life scenario in the lab.

14
00:00:37,575 --> 00:00:39,820
You'll be getting nosy by processing

15
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,259
some phone records and analyzing the patterns you find in them.

16
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:45,299
The last part of this course will be a bit different.

17
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:48,640
At this point, you'll know enough Python to write large programs.

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,265
So instead of learning more syntax,

19
00:00:50,265 --> 00:00:54,774
we'll focus on how to approach real problems and how to design programs to solve them.

20
00:00:54,774 --> 00:00:57,045
We'll show you how to break problems down into smaller ones.

21
00:00:57,045 --> 00:01:00,685
And Sharon and I will demonstrate this process by writing a web crawler together.

22
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:02,000
Let's go and learn some Python.
