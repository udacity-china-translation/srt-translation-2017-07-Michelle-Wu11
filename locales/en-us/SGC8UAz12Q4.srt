1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,585
So now, I've written my stub. And I'm going to modify daysInMonth to be

2
00:00:04,585 --> 00:00:08,838
correct for all months except for February in leap years. So, to do that, we've

3
00:00:08,838 --> 00:00:13,255
got to know how many days there are in a month, and I need Wikipedia for this.

4
00:00:13,256 --> 00:00:20,004
You may already know. Here we go. Here's the number of days in months. We have

5
00:00:20,004 --> 00:00:26,997
31 days in January, March, and May, July, August, October, and December, so

6
00:00:26,997 --> 00:00:32,046
let's write our code. And I'm writing this using only things we've seen through

7
00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:36,704
unit 2. If I was writing this for real, I would do something a little bit easier

8
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:41,535
to type. And those are the 31 day months. An easier way to write this would be

9
00:00:41,535 --> 00:00:45,223
to just list them all like this. That would mean the same thing but using a

10
00:00:45,223 --> 00:00:49,535
topple. We'll keep things only using things we've seen through unit 2. So, if

11
00:00:49,535 --> 00:00:53,800
the month is one of those, we return 31. If the month is February, we're going

12
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,819
to return 28. And this is the case we're going to have to do something more

13
00:00:57,819 --> 00:01:02,217
complicated if it's a leap year, and otherwise we're going to return 30. So, at

14
00:01:02,217 --> 00:01:06,633
this point, we should be able to add some tests, that should be correct now, if

15
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:11,102
we are not in a leap year, the day after February 28th is going to be March 1st.

16
00:01:11,102 --> 00:01:17,744
And a month that has 30 days, let's pick one, is September, it'll be October

17
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,126
1st. I think that's enough. The other test case, I think it would be good. That

18
00:01:21,126 --> 00:01:24,410
at this point, is something that looks at a whole year. If it's a non-leap year,

19
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:29,035
we should correctly have 365 days. Okay, so now I've got some more test cases,

20
00:01:29,035 --> 00:01:33,382
and they should be correct, even for months that don't have 30 days, so let's

21
00:01:33,382 --> 00:01:38,495
try. See if I made any mistakes. And all the tests finished, so it sounds like

22
00:01:38,495 --> 00:01:39,333
they're correct.
