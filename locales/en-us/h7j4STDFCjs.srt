00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
In this lesson, we use git init to create our own repository.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,050
We used git clone to copy an existing repository,

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:12,179
and we used git status to determine the status of a repository.

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,548
Now, you might want to just jump right into making commits

5
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:17,449
because a repository isn't very useful without them.

6
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:18,869
But before we start,

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,914
being able to review commits will help immensely when we start making our own.

8
00:00:22,914 --> 00:00:26,710
So, let's learn how to review existing commits.
