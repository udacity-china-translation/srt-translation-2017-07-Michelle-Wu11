1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
We just covered a ton of information in this lesson.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,120
We looked at using git add to stage content.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,144
We used git commit to actually commit changes to the repository.

4
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:13,324
We also looked at what makes a good commit message.

5
00:00:13,324 --> 00:00:15,809
Then we learned about how helpful git diff can

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,054
be to help us recall changes that haven't been committed yet.

7
00:00:19,054 --> 00:00:21,210
And last, we just looked at the git ignore

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,185
file to tell git what files it should not track.

9
00:00:24,184 --> 00:00:26,849
You now know how to create or clone a repo,

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,500
how to make professional commits with

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,344
clear descriptive commit messages and then how to review existing commits.

12
00:00:33,344 --> 00:00:38,344
With this knowledge, you can jump in and start working on any git repository.

13
00:00:38,344 --> 00:00:41,579
One powerful concept, we'll look at in the next lesson is branching.

14
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,284
Branching lets you work on a project in multiple different states

15
00:00:45,284 --> 00:00:49,209
and it will take your git skills to the next level. Let's go check it out.
