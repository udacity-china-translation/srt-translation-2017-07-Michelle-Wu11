00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
When I was first learning Git,

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,985
one of the hardest things for me to pick up on were all the various terms that were used.

3
00:00:06,985 --> 00:00:10,150
For those of you that see a big long list of terms and zone out,

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,109
don't worry, just skim the list for big picture ideas.

5
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:16,364
If you're like me and like knowing the terms that are being used,

6
00:00:16,364 --> 00:00:18,139
then this section's for you.

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,310
These terms are the vocabulary we use to talk about version control,

8
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:24,195
features of a version control system,

9
00:00:24,195 --> 00:00:28,875
changes we like to make to our code while it's in a version control system, and so on.

10
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,585
Some terms are, well,

11
00:00:30,585 --> 00:00:34,155
version control system, source code manager, commit,

12
00:00:34,155 --> 00:00:37,125
repository, repo, checkout, working directory, staging area,

13
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,639
the index, staging index, SHA, branching,

14
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,435
merging, merge conflicts, remotes.

15
00:00:40,435 --> 00:00:42,785
Get these things out of here.

16
00:00:42,784 --> 00:00:46,314
So yeah, the terminology can be a bit overwhelming.

17
00:00:46,314 --> 00:00:48,989
There are a number of good handouts around the web, though,

18
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,545
but I've created one for you that lists

19
00:00:50,545 --> 00:00:55,234
the most important terms along with a brief definition as a companion to this course.

20
00:00:55,234 --> 00:00:58,530
I highly recommend that you download this right now.

21
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,965
Place it on your desktop, or print it out and have it on your desk.

22
00:01:01,965 --> 00:01:05,335
Use it as we progress through the course to review key terms.

23
00:01:05,334 --> 00:01:07,199
At first, the words might not make any sense

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,409
because this is one of those chicken and egg scenarios.

25
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:12,733
Should I learn the terminology first or how to actually use Git?

26
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:15,149
I think it's easiest if you learn Git if

27
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,900
you have some familiarity with the terms it uses.

28
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,989
In addition, it might be helpful for you to create your own cheatsheet.

29
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:24,570
If you get stuck on a word or idea, just write it down.

30
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:28,139
So if you get a handle on version control's somewhat foreign terminology,

31
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,290
you're already a giant step towards becoming a Git master.
