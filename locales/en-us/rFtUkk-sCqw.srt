1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,583
When a commit is made,

2
00:00:01,583 --> 00:00:06,320
only the changes that are on the staging index are moved into the repository.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,330
If we want to include the second set of changes in the commit,

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,359
then we need to stage the changes.

5
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:14,858
Now that the second change to the HTML file has been staged,

6
00:00:14,858 --> 00:00:19,350
the two sets of changes to the HTML file are combined into just one set of changes.

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,950
And then we can commit like normal to move these changes into the repository.

8
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:25,644
We have all of these changes saved in our repository,

9
00:00:25,644 --> 00:00:28,039
but how do we access these commits?

10
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:30,344
What if we want to look at this specific commit?

11
00:00:30,344 --> 00:00:31,919
When each commit is made,

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,899
git creates an ID for it.

13
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:36,278
The ID for the commit is its SHA,

14
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:41,230
the first seven characters what each commits SHA might look like.
