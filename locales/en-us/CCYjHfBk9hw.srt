1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,915
Here are the configuration file that I've downloaded and unzipped.

2
00:00:03,915 --> 00:00:06,890
I need to move these files into the home directory.

3
00:00:06,889 --> 00:00:09,509
The easiest way is to right click on the window and

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:12,914
choose Git Bash Here from the list of options.

5
00:00:12,914 --> 00:00:17,364
This option shows up because I've already installed Git on this machine.

6
00:00:17,364 --> 00:00:21,000
In the shell, just type cd and press enter.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,164
This moves the shell to the home directory.

8
00:00:23,164 --> 00:00:25,235
To open this director in Windows Explorer,

9
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:27,934
type start and a period.

10
00:00:27,934 --> 00:00:31,070
I like being able to jump to this directory,

11
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,710
so I'll pin this to the quick access menu.

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:40,490
To do that right click on quick access and choose "Pin current folder to Quick access".

13
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,585
Now let me shift these windows around to organize them better.

14
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,335
Now that we have the home directory open,

15
00:00:45,335 --> 00:00:47,590
we can move the configuration files over.

16
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,465
Select both items and drag them to the home directory window.

17
00:00:51,465 --> 00:00:54,135
They're in the correct location.

18
00:00:54,134 --> 00:00:56,644
Now they just need to be named correctly.

19
00:00:56,645 --> 00:01:00,550
Both files need to have a dot at the beginning of their names.

20
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:03,589
Since Windows rename feature doesn't allow that,

21
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,659
we have to do it on the command line.

22
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:11,914
We'll use the mv command to rename bash_profile to.bash_profile.

23
00:01:11,915 --> 00:01:14,160
We'll do the same thing with the folder.

24
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,859
We'll use the mv command to

25
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:20,209
rename you udacity-terminal-config to.udacity-terminal-config.

26
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:23,939
To see the changes we'll have to open a new shell.

27
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:27,613
So the shell is now configured with the correct content,

28
00:01:27,614 --> 00:01:31,230
but I also like having a white background with black text,

29
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,855
so I click in the top left corner of the app,

30
00:01:33,855 --> 00:01:37,350
choose options, and then update

31
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:43,243
the foreground color to black and the background color to white.

32
00:01:43,243 --> 00:01:46,430
Perfect. Now everything is configured.
