1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,374
I've downloaded the files and unzipped the directory.

2
00:00:03,374 --> 00:00:07,513
In the Terminal, I'll type cd to make sure I'm in the home directory.

3
00:00:07,514 --> 00:00:09,525
Using the move command,

4
00:00:09,525 --> 00:00:13,794
I'll move the udacity-terminal-config directory into my home directory,

5
00:00:13,794 --> 00:00:17,969
but I also want to rename it by adding a dot at the front.

6
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:20,018
Since the Terminal is in the home directory,

7
00:00:20,018 --> 00:00:27,659
I'll move this directory into the home directory and name it.udacity-terminal-config.

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,056
The bash_profile file also needs to be in my home directory,

9
00:00:31,056 --> 00:00:34,034
but this is a very common file and if I already have this file,

10
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,750
then I don't want to overwrite it.

11
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:42,863
I'll use ls -a to check if I already have one.

12
00:00:42,863 --> 00:00:45,959
I already have a bash_profile file,

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,829
so I'll open it up in my code editor.

14
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:54,594
Now that I have this file open,

15
00:00:54,594 --> 00:00:59,879
I just need to copy the text out of here into this file.

16
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:10,419
Now just save the file and I'm done.

17
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,915
If you don't already have a bash_profile file,

18
00:01:12,915 --> 00:01:17,400
then you'd use the move command to move this file into your home directory,

19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,984
making sure to name it with a dot at the beginning.

20
00:01:19,984 --> 00:01:24,545
But I'm not going to run this because I already have updated my.bash_profile file.

21
00:01:24,545 --> 00:01:27,013
Now even though I've updated my bash_profile,

22
00:01:27,013 --> 00:01:28,996
nothing's changed with the Terminal.

23
00:01:28,996 --> 00:01:32,561
That's because I need to restart it.

24
00:01:32,561 --> 00:01:35,469
So here's what your Terminal should look like.
