00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,940
For most real world problems, it's up to you to figure out how to encode the

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,600
inputs and this is one of the most important decisions that you can make in

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,930
solving a problem. For the problems that we've used in CS 101, because they need

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:16,017
to be automatically graded and we want to run your code on test but we need to

5
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:20,376
specify carefully what the inputs are and how they're encoded. In this case, the

6
00:00:20,376 --> 00:00:24,102
template for the problem indicates how the inputs are represented, that there's

7
00:00:24,102 --> 00:00:27,558
six parameters to the daysBetweenDates procedure, year one, month one, day

8
00:00:27,558 --> 00:00:31,014
one, and year two, month two, day two, and that means we're going to be passing

9
00:00:31,014 --> 00:00:34,680
in six different values to represent those two dates. Those of you who've got a

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,082
little further in the class will rise that there's better ways we might have

11
00:00:38,082 --> 00:00:41,592
used to package the year, month and day into one object, but based on what we've

12
00:00:41,592 --> 00:00:45,450
seen only through unit two, passing them in as separate values makes sense. So

13
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,713
our solution needs to use inputs represented this way.
