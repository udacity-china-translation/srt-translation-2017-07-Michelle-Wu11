00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,810
Here's the outline for this course you're taking right now.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,919
Let's click on this link to get to its revision history page.

3
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:10,108
This main part shows the document that we see in

4
00:00:10,108 --> 00:00:15,169
the normal view but this sidebar provides all the awesome features we want.

5
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:18,449
This is the history of the changes made to this document.

6
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,030
They're organized by date and show who made the edits.

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,579
Clicking on one of these will swap out

8
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:26,320
the current version of the document with an older one.

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,550
Let's click on the October 13 version.

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,590
The main area now shows the version of the document as it appeared on October 13.

11
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,140
It also provides these arrows to let us jump to the edits that were made.

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:44,493
The highlight color indicates which user made the edit.

13
00:00:44,493 --> 00:00:46,700
If I like this older version of the document,

14
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,920
I can replace the current version with this older

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,274
one by clicking the Restore this revision link.

16
00:00:52,274 --> 00:00:54,664
One last thing is that Google Docs will group

17
00:00:54,664 --> 00:00:57,689
lots of changes together in one larger group.

18
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:00,048
If you want to see smaller sets of changes,

19
00:01:00,048 --> 00:01:03,658
that's what the, Show more detailed revisions button does.
