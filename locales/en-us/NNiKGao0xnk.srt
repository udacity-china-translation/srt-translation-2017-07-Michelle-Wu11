1
00:00:00,151 --> 00:00:02,911
>> So when did people first
start to use A/B testing?

2
00:00:02,911 --> 00:00:06,447
>> A/B testing has been around
a long time, maybe we didn't call it

3
00:00:06,447 --> 00:00:10,242
A/B testing, but it typically came
from field such as agriculture,

4
00:00:10,242 --> 00:00:13,845
where people would actually divide
up their land into sections and

5
00:00:13,845 --> 00:00:17,610
then test what would work better for
a particular crop or how it grew.

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,654
And so there have been a lot of
different fields that use what's

7
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:22,731
effectively A/B testing for a long time.

8
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,515
>> In the sciences more generally,

9
00:00:24,515 --> 00:00:28,408
hypotheses testing is a key way that
they really determine innovation.

10
00:00:28,408 --> 00:00:32,220
In medicine, for example, their version
of A/B testing is called clinical trials

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,406
and that's how they determine whether
a new drug is effective or not.

12
00:00:35,406 --> 00:00:38,422
>> The key thing that you want to
see in A/B testing is that you have

13
00:00:38,422 --> 00:00:41,902
a consistent response from your
control and your experiment group, so

14
00:00:41,902 --> 00:00:45,498
that you can actually really determine
and structure the experiment, so

15
00:00:45,498 --> 00:00:49,094
you can determine whether there's
a significant behavior change in your

16
00:00:49,094 --> 00:00:51,772
experiment group as opposed
to in your control group.

17
00:00:51,772 --> 00:00:52,504
>> Okay.

18
00:00:52,504 --> 00:00:56,047
So what's the difference between
running these types of experiments and

19
00:00:56,047 --> 00:00:57,425
running online A/B tests?

20
00:00:57,425 --> 00:01:00,840
>> Well, in the online world we
often have a lot more data but

21
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,487
kind of lower resolution.

22
00:01:02,487 --> 00:01:07,165
So in a traditional medical trial or
in a user experience research study,

23
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:10,490
you might have ten, twenty,
fifty participants.

24
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:14,295
So normally is the analysis different,
because you have to be very careful,

25
00:01:14,295 --> 00:01:17,044
but you know a lot about each
participant in your trial,

26
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:19,108
so you may know their age, their weight.

27
00:01:19,108 --> 00:01:22,429
You know its a single person, you have
their drivers license, all this stuff.

28
00:01:22,429 --> 00:01:25,493
You may have met them,
whereas in an online study,

29
00:01:25,493 --> 00:01:30,428
you may have millions of users, hundreds
of thousands of clicks, respondents.

30
00:01:30,428 --> 00:01:33,746
But you don't really know that
much about who's on the other end

31
00:01:33,746 --> 00:01:34,491
of that data.

32
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:38,097
So, it may be something where you have
trouble distinguishing whether this is

33
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:40,621
a single person,
whether there's multiple people.

34
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:42,790
Is it an internet cafe computer?

35
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,065
And those are issues that really
come up in online user data.

36
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:48,550
>> The key thing to remember
is that in the online world,

37
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:52,086
when you're doing A/B testing, the goal
really is to determine whether or

38
00:01:52,086 --> 00:01:55,587
not this new product or this new feature
is something that users will like.

39
00:01:55,587 --> 00:01:59,683
And so the goal in A/B testing is to
design an experiment, that's going to be

40
00:01:59,683 --> 00:02:03,844
robust and give you repeatable results,
so that you can actually make a good

41
00:02:03,844 --> 00:02:07,960
decision about whether or not to
actually launch that product or feature.

42
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,715
>> Sounds good.

43
00:02:08,715 --> 00:02:10,538
I know Udacity uses A/B testing.

44
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:12,198
How about other tech companies?

45
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:13,638
>> It's everywhere right now.

46
00:02:13,638 --> 00:02:16,484
Google, Microsoft,
eBay, PayPal, Netflix,

47
00:02:16,484 --> 00:02:20,359
like all of the major companies
are definitely using A/B testing.

48
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:23,211
There are even companies that
focus on providing those services

49
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:25,970
to smaller companies,
like optimizing their sites better.
