1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,544
We've got here the three sections of our repository: the working directory,

2
00:00:04,544 --> 00:00:07,609
the staging index, and the repository up at the top.

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,714
Let's say our repo currently has these commits in it,

4
00:00:10,714 --> 00:00:13,650
with master currently pointing at the most recent commit.

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,583
We have HEAD pointing at master,

6
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:18,199
and our files are in the working directory.

7
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:20,504
Let's shift things around a second.

8
00:00:20,504 --> 00:00:25,634
These are the three places content from a reset commit will go: the working directory,

9
00:00:25,635 --> 00:00:27,828
the staging index, and the trash,

10
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:29,425
meaning it'll be erased.

11
00:00:29,425 --> 00:00:35,230
Running git reset HEAD's parent will move HEAD and master to the previous commit.

12
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:39,003
But what happens to the commit with the number three?

13
00:00:39,003 --> 00:00:43,618
The changes that were made could be moved to the working directory or the staging index,

14
00:00:43,618 --> 00:00:45,329
or they could just be thrown out.

15
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:48,979
It all depends on the flag that's used with the reset command.

16
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:50,399
Let's move this commit back.

17
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,265
If we run git reset without any flags,

18
00:00:53,265 --> 00:00:55,378
then the changes that were made in the commit with

19
00:00:55,378 --> 00:00:59,159
SHA-3 are applied to the files in the working directory.

20
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:02,169
This is because --mixed is the default.

21
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:06,704
So running get reset without a flag is the same as running it with --mixed.

22
00:01:06,704 --> 00:01:08,905
So if we stage the files and commit again,

23
00:01:08,905 --> 00:01:11,230
we'll get the same commit content.

24
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,259
We'll get a different commit SHA just because

25
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,015
the time stamp of the commit will be different from the original one,

26
00:01:16,015 --> 00:01:18,939
but the commit content will be exactly the same.

27
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:22,379
Using the --soft flag will move

28
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:26,609
the changes that were made in the commit with SHA-3 to the staging index.

29
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:29,359
It's the same changes and now they're even staged for you.

30
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,504
All you have to do is run git commit to get the commit back.

31
00:01:32,504 --> 00:01:34,828
Again, since the time stamp is different,

32
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,209
the new commit SHA will be different.

33
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:40,229
The last is the --hard flag.

34
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:44,040
This one will throw out all of the changes that were made in the commit with SHA-3.
