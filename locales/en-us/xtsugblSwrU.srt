00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,965
I have a confession to make.

2
00:00:01,965 --> 00:00:05,088
When I first learned about the oneline flag for git log,

3
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:07,095
I was really excited about it.

4
00:00:07,094 --> 00:00:10,818
Now I didn't have to scroll and scroll and scroll to read all of the comment messages.

5
00:00:10,819 --> 00:00:15,420
It worked for a couple of times until one time I got this.

6
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:16,864
Why isn't it working now?

7
00:00:16,864 --> 00:00:18,574
I tried restarting the terminal.

8
00:00:18,574 --> 00:00:23,350
That didn't do anything. I restarted my computer and that didn't help.

9
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:27,685
Finally, I actually read Git's helpful error message carefully.

10
00:00:27,684 --> 00:00:31,479
I had typed out "online" instead of oneline.

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,039
It says, "fatal: unrecognized argument: --online."

12
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,905
Online is unrecognized, which means Git doesn't know about it.

13
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:41,175
This error message, or something similar,

14
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:43,399
is common to run into while programming.

15
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:44,807
So, keep an eye out for it.

16
00:00:44,807 --> 00:00:49,340
Unfound or unrecognized arguments often mean a simple spelling mistake.

17
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,435
So, the moral of the story, spelling is important.

18
00:00:53,435 --> 00:00:56,135
Make sure you actually spell things correctly.

19
00:00:56,134 --> 00:00:59,019
Also, Git will try and provide helpful feedback.

20
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,400
Make sure you read it carefully.
