1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,236
So here's what I'll suggest is my favorite ordering, is we're going to first

2
00:00:04,236 --> 00:00:08,460
write a stub, daysInMonth, that will take a year and a month and return always

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,663
30, which certainly not correct. Then we'll modify our nextDay routine to use

4
00:00:12,663 --> 00:00:16,300
that stub, and then, right away, we'll test it. At this point, we won't have

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,550
done anything that will actually change the outputs from what we were getting

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,800
before if things are correct. But we're now restructure the code in a way that

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,760
all we have to do is improve daysInMonth. And then we've got the correct answer.

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,674
The next thing we'll do is modify daysInMonth to be correct, except for leap

9
00:00:31,674 --> 00:00:35,020
years. I'm putting off leap years as long as I can because I think leap years

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,530
are really annoying. But there are also a complexity that only comes up

11
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,910
occasionally. And we can have really close to a correct answer and know that

12
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,174
we've got all the structure of the code and everything in good place, putting

13
00:00:45,174 --> 00:00:48,882
that off. So, I'll do that. Then I think it's a good idea to test again. So

14
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:52,858
we're going to do the testing again in step five, and it would have been

15
00:00:52,858 --> 00:00:57,648
perfectly okay to do the testing using daysInMonth. I think it's easier to do it

16
00:00:57,648 --> 00:01:02,236
using nextDay, since I can just keep rerunning the same tests that I did for

17
00:01:02,236 --> 00:01:06,541
step three. Now, I've got to the point where I really can't put off leap years

18
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:10,427
any longer, so I'm going to do the leap years next, and I'll write a helper

19
00:01:10,427 --> 00:01:15,097
procedure isLeapYear. That's step 6. And I'm going to test that separately.

20
00:01:15,098 --> 00:01:18,532
That's another step that you could argue, well, I could test that using

21
00:01:18,532 --> 00:01:22,375
daysInMonth or using nextDay. In this case isLeapYear, they're enough special

22
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:26,108
cases that it makes more sense to test that separately. Okay, and after I've

23
00:01:26,108 --> 00:01:30,195
done that I should have a fully correct solution. I could test it separately,

24
00:01:30,195 --> 00:01:33,749
but I'm pretty confident in the rest of my code at this point. I'm going to jump

25
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:37,450
right ahead to step K and run all the test cases. So this is order I'd

26
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,720
recommend, but there's plenty of other orders that make sense. One thing that

27
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,570
would certainly make sense would be to move the leap year stuff to the

28
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:48,048
beginning. If you like leap years, and don't want to put that off, easy to do

29
00:01:48,048 --> 00:01:51,956
that separately first. The other thing that could happen is instead of using the

30
00:01:51,956 --> 00:01:55,176
nextDay test, use the daysInMonth test. That would be perfectly reasonable as

31
00:01:55,176 --> 00:01:58,395
well. So there are lots of correct answers to this question. The property that

32
00:01:58,395 --> 00:02:02,348
they should all have, all the correct answers, is that you're writing small bits

33
00:02:02,348 --> 00:02:06,022
of code that you can test independently as you go. You don't want to be writing

34
00:02:06,022 --> 00:02:09,514
a lot of code and not being able to test it. That's one of the most important

35
00:02:09,514 --> 00:02:12,938
things to learn as a developer is to think of ways to structure a code, to

36
00:02:12,938 --> 00:02:16,708
organize the way you build code, so you're able to do meaningful tests as you go

37
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:20,304
and see the code incrementally get closer to the solution that you need for

38
00:02:20,304 --> 00:02:24,132
that. As you get more confident as a programmer, you might skip some of these

39
00:02:24,132 --> 00:02:27,540
steps. But part of my motivation in asking this question is, when I tried to

40
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,115
solve this problem myself, I had a bug in my solution, because I didn't do these

41
00:02:31,115 --> 00:02:35,278
steps carefully enough. And I've tried running all the test cases and they all

42
00:02:35,278 --> 00:02:39,440
failed. And, debugging it took a lot longer than if I'd followed this pattern.

43
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,470
What I'm going to encourage you to do as you develop your solution, is to write

44
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,550
code to run all these tests as part of your solution. And, what I hope will

45
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,937
happen, if you do these steps, testing as you go. When you finally get to step

46
00:02:51,937 --> 00:02:56,215
K, and run it on all the test cases, it will magically all work correctly the

47
00:02:56,215 --> 00:03:00,014
first time. Except, it won't be magic. It'll be the result of building things in

48
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:01,453
a systematic and careful way.
