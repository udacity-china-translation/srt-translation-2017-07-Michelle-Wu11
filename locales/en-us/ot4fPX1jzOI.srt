1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,575
Branches, merges, and merge conflicts.

2
00:00:02,575 --> 00:00:06,515
Wow, this lesson had a ton of useful information in it.

3
00:00:06,514 --> 00:00:10,129
Branches let us work in isolation from the rest of the project.

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,280
Then after you're finished,

5
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:14,219
you can use Git to merge your branches together.

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,109
Now, it doesn't happen all the time,

7
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:17,730
but if there's a merge conflict,

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,179
just pop open your editor and search for the merge conflict indicators.

9
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:23,501
Remove the lines with the indicators,

10
00:00:23,501 --> 00:00:25,530
figure out what lines you're going to keep,

11
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,510
save the file, stage the file,

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,179
and then commit. Easy-peasy.

13
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:33,500
Congratulations, you are now a Git master.

14
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,939
But if you'd like to learn one last skill,

15
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:38,519
check out the next lesson where we look at editing,

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,000
undoing, and erasing commits.
