00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,504
This is the sample git repository we built up in the previous lesson.

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,585
There are just a number of commits in the repository,

3
00:00:06,585 --> 00:00:08,339
and there's a tag on one of the commits.

4
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:10,894
In addition to the tag, there's also a branch.

5
00:00:10,894 --> 00:00:13,515
It's been hidden all this time, but let's show it.

6
00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:18,170
By default, the first branch name is "master" but that's not a special name.

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,210
It's just the default name that's provided by git.

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,515
Now here's the cool part.

9
00:00:22,515 --> 00:00:25,710
When a commit is made in the repository it's added to

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,380
the branch and the branch pointer moves to point to it.

11
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:30,798
Pretty neat, right?

12
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:34,289
If you remember, a tag is a permanent pointer to a commit,

13
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:38,814
and it doesn't move, but a branch does move when a new commit is added.

14
00:00:38,814 --> 00:00:42,899
Let's add another branch to the repository and call it "sidebar".

15
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,738
Now, why would we want to do this?

16
00:00:44,738 --> 00:00:48,059
Well, branches are incredibly powerful because they let us

17
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,380
work on the same project in different isolated environments.

18
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,895
Hold tight for a second and we'll see how this works.

19
00:00:54,895 --> 00:00:56,804
A question you might be asking is,

20
00:00:56,804 --> 00:00:58,320
"If we make a commit now,

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,070
which branch will move?

22
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,450
Will it be "master" or "sidebar"?"

23
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,445
Well, there's another hidden thing we need to reveal.

24
00:01:06,444 --> 00:01:09,119
It's the oddly named "head" pointer,

25
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,609
and it points to the branch that's active.

26
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:14,170
Right now it's pointing to the "master" branch,

27
00:01:14,171 --> 00:01:16,980
so "master" is the active branch.

28
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,969
We can use the checkout command to switch which branch it's pointing to.

29
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:23,010
To switch to the "sidebar" branch,

30
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,120
we'd use the command "git checkout sidebar".

31
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,255
Let's switch back with "git checkout master. "

32
00:01:29,254 --> 00:01:31,304
If we make a commit right now,

33
00:01:31,305 --> 00:01:34,140
the commit is added to the branch that "head" points to

34
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,680
because "head" indicates the current or active branch.

35
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,875
Let's switch over to the "sidebar" branch and add a commit there.

36
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:42,861
Now that "head" points to "sidebar,

37
00:01:42,861 --> 00:01:46,840
" making commits now will add them to the "sidebar" branch.

38
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,530
Not only can we have as many branches as we want,

39
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,960
but we can choose where it starts from.

40
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:55,819
Let's say there's a problem with our header that was introduced back on commit a.

41
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:59,314
We can create a new branch right there with the branch command,

42
00:01:59,314 --> 00:02:03,299
switch to it with the checkout command,

43
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:10,164
and make the necessary changes to fix the problem.

44
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:13,884
There's one quick but very important thing that I need to point out.

45
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:17,719
Let's switch back to the "master" branch for a second and make a commit.

46
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:20,879
The word "master" here indicates the tip of the branch,

47
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,254
but this most recent commit is connected to past commits.

48
00:02:24,254 --> 00:02:28,229
The red line indicates all of the commits that are in the "master" branch.

49
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:32,519
So the commits 7 and b are not included in the "master" branch,

50
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,870
and the commits f and 4 are not in the "master" branch either.

51
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,015
So if we open up our code editor right now,

52
00:02:39,014 --> 00:02:42,824
the changes that we made on commits f, 4, 7,

53
00:02:42,824 --> 00:02:45,704
and b will not appear in any of the files

54
00:02:45,705 --> 00:02:49,490
because git is only showing changes that are in the "master" branch.

55
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,754
Don't worry though. These commits are stored safely in the repository.

56
00:02:52,754 --> 00:02:54,585
To get those commits out of the repository,

57
00:02:54,585 --> 00:02:58,150
we just need to switch to the branch that has the commits we're looking for.

58
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,425
For example, if we switch to the header-fix branch,

59
00:03:01,425 --> 00:03:04,410
the commits that are included on that branch will now

60
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:08,000
appear in the computer's file system and in the code editor.
