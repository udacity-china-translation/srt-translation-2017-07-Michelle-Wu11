00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,009
You've already interacted with the HTML in

2
00:00:03,009 --> 00:00:06,125
a Wikipedia page via your browser's developer tools.

3
00:00:06,125 --> 00:00:10,125
Now, let's figure out how to get that HTML into Python,

4
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:12,660
so we can work with it programmatically.

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,474
I'll start with an internet search for,

6
00:00:14,474 --> 00:00:19,829
"Python request web page from a URL."

7
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:24,899
Okay. This first link looks like it's from the Python three docs, which is great.

8
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,109
I'll click it and see what it says.

9
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:28,710
Let's take a look.

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,080
This yellow box stands out.

11
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:36,769
The requests package is recommended for a higher level HTTP client interface.

12
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,085
High level is probably what we want.

13
00:00:39,085 --> 00:00:43,170
Let's try to keep things simple for a first attempt at getting a page from the web.

14
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,020
I think I'll try using the request package.

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,300
Okay, the docs for the request package are a little bit silly.

16
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:55,649
It's says, "Safe for human consumption," so that's reassuring, I think.

17
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:58,524
Here's a simple bit of code to get us started.

18
00:00:58,524 --> 00:01:03,109
I'm going to try it because request is not part of the standard library,

19
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:08,784
I'll need to get it installed first using pip, pip3 install requests.

20
00:01:08,784 --> 00:01:10,653
Okay, that's now installed.

21
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:16,560
Great. Now, I'll fire up the Python interactive interpreter to test the example code.

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,439
I'll copy the format of this code to get

23
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,159
the HTML for the Wikipedia page on the dead parrot sketch.

24
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,674
First, I import requests,

25
00:01:25,674 --> 00:01:27,606
I'll call the variable response,

26
00:01:27,606 --> 00:01:35,730
it's a bit more descriptive than they are in the example,

27
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,469
response equals requests dot get parenthesis and inside the parenthesis

28
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:44,694
I will put the URL for the Wikipedia page on the dead parrot sketch.

29
00:01:44,694 --> 00:01:47,159
The example code shows several things I can do to

30
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,890
get information after this response object.

31
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,060
But what I really want,

32
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:57,930
is to see the HTML of the page itself that's held in the text attribute of the response.

33
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,644
Let's print it to have a look.

34
00:02:01,644 --> 00:02:04,227
Okay.

35
00:02:04,227 --> 00:02:08,140
Wow, that's a lot of content on this page.

36
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:11,329
I recognized some of the tags we might expect to see,

37
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,540
there's an anchor tag,

38
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:16,384
and there's a div,

39
00:02:16,384 --> 00:02:19,424
but it's a little difficult to read this.

40
00:02:19,425 --> 00:02:23,420
It's much more difficult than just looking at the rendered page itself.

41
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:27,709
So, it looks like a lot of text but let's just

42
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:33,930
check what type this response.text actually is.

43
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:40,010
Okay, it's just the string that contains all the HTML of the Wikipedia page.
