1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,860
So we've seen the basic looking at just the first

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,200
letter does not work very well, doesn't use enough buckets.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,390
And it doesn't distribute the keys well. So now we're

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,310
going to think about how to make a better hash

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,360
function. So we want the same property we had before

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,160
in the sense that it's one function that takes two

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,630
inputs and that two inputs are the keyword which is

8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,940
a string and the number of buckets, which is a number.

9
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,040
Those are the two inputs and the output is the

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,700
hash value and it's in the range from zero to

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,120
number of buckets minus one. And our goal is for

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,030
these numbers to well distributed, so we can have any

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,610
number of buckets we want. The keywords will be spread

14
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,440
evenly among the buckets, and every time we hash the

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,010
same keyword we'll get the same bucket. So, we'll know

16
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,210
quickly where to find it. So in order to do better

17
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,240
than we were doing before, we're going to need to look at more

18
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,520
than just one letter of the keyword. If we look at just the

19
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,410
first letter, we're not going to do better than having a limited number

20
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,790
of buckets in a bad distribution. So, what we want to do is

21
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,070
something that's going to look at all the letters of the keyword, not

22
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,796
just the first letter. And based on all the letters, we'll decide their

23
00:01:06,796 --> 00:01:10,877
appropriate bucket. We saw that with lists, if we had a list of

24
00:01:10,877 --> 00:01:15,865
items, we could use the for loop construct to go through the elements

25
00:01:15,865 --> 00:01:19,227
in the list, like this. And this will go through each

26
00:01:19,227 --> 00:01:22,314
element in p, assigning it to the variable e and executing

27
00:01:22,314 --> 00:01:25,370
is whatever is in the block for each element of p.

28
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,360
We can do something similar with strings, so if we have

29
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,830
a string s, we can use the same construct to go

30
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,966
through the characters in s. So each time we go through

31
00:01:33,966 --> 00:01:36,976
the loop, the value assigned to variable c will be a

32
00:01:36,976 --> 00:01:41,482
one letter string corresponding to each character in the string in order.

33
00:01:41,482 --> 00:01:43,407
So first it will have the value a, and then

34
00:01:43,407 --> 00:01:45,860
value b, and then value c, and then value d.

35
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,472
So this gives us a way to go through all

36
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:51,100
the elements in the string. And if you remember how we

37
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:56,760
turned single letter strings into numbers and modular arithmetic, then

38
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,970
I think you know enough to define a much better hash

39
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,740
function. So for this quiz, your goal is to define

40
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,650
a function hash_string that behaves like this. It takes a keyword,

41
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,850
a number of buckets, and it gives it number, identifying the bucket

42
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,670
where that keyword will belong. But instead of just using the first

43
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,301
letter in the keyword, it's going to use all the letters. And produces

44
00:02:16,301 --> 00:02:18,070
as output, a single number that

45
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:21,060
represents the bucket where that keyword belongs.

46
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,740
And your goal is to do this in a way that depends

47
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,070
on all the characters in the string, not just the first character.

48
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,100
There are lots of ways to do this, so we're going to

49
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,790
specify exactly what you should do. So what we want to do is make

50
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:35,090
the output of hash string a function of all the characters.

51
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,950
And we can think of that with modular arithmetic, that if we

52
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,070
have a circle which is the size of the number of

53
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:44,555
buckets, so this is going to go from 0 to the buckets minus

54
00:02:44,555 --> 00:02:46,970
1. But what we want to do for each character, we are

55
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,140
going to start at 0 and for each character in the string, we

56
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,730
are going to go around ord of that character, distance around the circle,

57
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,820
and we are going to keep going. So each character we are going to

58
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,170
go some distance around the circle, the circle can

59
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,353
be any size depending on the number of buckets and

60
00:03:01,353 --> 00:03:05,700
we're going to keep going around the circle using modular arithmetic

61
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,170
for each letter. And as we keep going, we can

62
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,670
go lots and lots of times if it's a big

63
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,355
word. Wherever we end up is going to be the

64
00:03:14,355 --> 00:03:19,067
bucket that we use. And let's say that's position 27,

65
00:03:19,067 --> 00:03:21,995
who knows where it is. So that's the idea and

66
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:23,638
I'll give you a couple of examples so

67
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:25,956
you know if you're implementing it the right way.

68
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:29,544
Let's suppose we have as our string the single

69
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:33,430
letter a, and we have 12 buckets. Well in

70
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,710
that case we're going to have 12 buckets, so

71
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,046
we wouldn't have 27 here. This is going to be,

72
00:03:39,046 --> 00:03:47,355
11 is the last bucket, the ord value of a is 97. So for a, what we would

73
00:03:47,355 --> 00:03:52,602
do is go around the circle eight times,

74
00:03:52,602 --> 00:03:58,008
because 97 is 12 times 8, and one more,

75
00:03:58,008 --> 00:04:04,040
because 97 is 12 times 8 plus 1. You don't actually have to

76
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,360
go around the circle if you use the modulo that's what it will give you.

77
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,424
And so the hash value for a should end up in bucket one. As another

78
00:04:12,424 --> 00:04:15,574
example, if we tried hash string where the string

79
00:04:15,574 --> 00:04:18,949
is the single letter b, also with 12 buckets, well

80
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:21,949
that's going to also go around the circle eight

81
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:24,837
times because the ord of b is 98. But it's

82
00:04:24,837 --> 00:04:27,996
going to end up in bucket two, since that's 96

83
00:04:27,996 --> 00:04:31,660
plus 2, which will end up in bucket two. If

84
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,320
we change the number of buckets, the results will be

85
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,430
different, so let's say, instead of having 12 buckets we

86
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:42,190
have 13, and we tried hash_string on the

87
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:47,250
single letter string a, with 13 buckets. The result there should end

88
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:52,180
up being 6, and the reason it's 6 is because 97

89
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,080
is equal to 13 times 7 plus

90
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,490
6, so the size of the hash table matters, as well as the string. We don't want

91
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,877
it to just work on single letter strings. With single

92
00:05:04,877 --> 00:05:07,900
letter strings, we are really getting the same thing we defined

93
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,020
before, where it gets interesting is where we have multi letter

94
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,460
strings. So lets look at a few examples like that. So

95
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,360
where we can see the difference between what you are going to

96
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,960
find at hash_string and the bad_hash_string we had

97
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,870
before is once we have longer strings. So suppose we tried

98
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,870
the string au, the ord of a was 97, and that,

99
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:34,606
when we went around the circle, ended up at location 1. The ord of u, I

100
00:05:34,606 --> 00:05:41,607
can tell you, is 117. When we add those two, we get 214.

101
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:48,470
And modulo the number of buckets, which is 12 here, we should get 10.

102
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:53,090
So that string with two symbols doesn't end up in position one where the a would

103
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,471
end up. It ends up in bucket ten, and

104
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:59,293
as another example, we won't work through the details on

105
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:01,867
this one, but you'll be able to test if

106
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:05,611
your result is correct. If you try the string udacity,

107
00:06:05,611 --> 00:06:08,229
it should end up in the bucket sorry I

108
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:11,804
forgot the input size, this is very important. We need

109
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:14,339
two inputs to hash string, both the string and

110
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:18,482
the number of buckets matter. So here, we're also assuming

111
00:06:18,482 --> 00:06:24,094
12 buckets, here we'll use 12 buckets again, the result should be

112
00:06:24,094 --> 00:06:26,919
11. So see if you can define a function hash_string that does

113
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,880
this. And we want it to take these two inputs and produce

114
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,830
a number that tells us what bucket that keyword should be in.
