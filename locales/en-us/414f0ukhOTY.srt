1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,004
Let's say that our local repository has these branches in it.

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:08,844
Master, footer fix, and bugfix-login-form.

3
00:00:08,845 --> 00:00:10,075
These branches are local,

4
00:00:10,074 --> 00:00:12,509
meaning they exist only on our machine and are

5
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,000
not shared with other developers using the repository.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,410
When we create a remote repository,

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,390
it starts out empty, typically.

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,975
To get the commits that are on these branches over to the remote repository,

9
00:00:24,975 --> 00:00:26,760
we need to send them over.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,370
We can do this in two ways,

11
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:32,179
we can merge footer fix and bugfix-login-form into

12
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:36,000
master and just send master to the remote repository,

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
or we can send all three branches to the remote repository.
